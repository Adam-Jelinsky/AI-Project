# AI-Project
This is an old high school project that uses machine learning to play tic-tac-toe and recognize handwritten digits.

I originally wrote this project in grade 11 as a final project for my CS course and the only instructions from my teacher were to "make whatever 
you want and I will use it to help write recommendations for college applications".

This project is unecessarily complicated to set up because 11th grade me didn't know how to write a front-end that actually works.

In order to run the program, from an IDE like Eclipse or IneliJ run the main method in MenuScreen.java.

If you want to be able to retrain the handwritten digit classifier, you must first put all 4 files from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into the AI-Project folder. 
Then from an IDE like eclipse or InteliJ run the main method in ImageReader.java. This will give training and testing data for the model to use, and is not very optimal,
so it may take a while to run.
