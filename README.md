# AI-Project
This is an old high school project that uses machine learning to play tic-tac-toe and recognize handwritten digits.

In order to run the program, from an IDE like Eclipse or IneliJ run the main method in MenuScreen.java.

If you want to be able to retrain the handwritten digit classifier, you must first put all 4 files from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into the AI-Project folder. 
Then from an IDE like eclipse or InteliJ run the main method in ImageReader.java. This will give training and testing data for the model to use, and is not very optimal,
so it may take a while to run.
